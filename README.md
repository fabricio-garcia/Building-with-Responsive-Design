# Project: Building with Responsive Design

![TheNextWeb](img/Screenshot_20200405_190949.png)

## [Collaborative Project]

This project consists of replicating the [The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/) website putting emphasis on how it behaves differently depending on the size of the screen where the website is rendered.

You can find the original project specification [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-responsive-design).

## Additional Microverse Adjustments

### General

- Remember about descriptive README file.
- Inline comments: It’s better to delete commented code. If you need to review a previous version of your code, use git history.
- Files not related to the project should not be commited and added to `.gitignore`.
- Keep your [code clean](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp).
- Remember to use [semantic HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp).
- Validate your HTML markup with <https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload>
- Make sure you DON’T make [common mistakes](https://speckyboy.com/good-bad-css-practices/) in your CSS styles.

### Project specific

- Align all elements with [float](https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/) OR [flex](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) AND your own Grid as described in [previous lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/css-grids) .
- `[HINT]` This page should contain 3 breakpoints (you should figure out the exact width for each breakpoint by yourself).
- Remember to double-check if you page layout does not brake on smaller screens.
